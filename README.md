Compendium of scripts I have created/used/modified for different tasks

* demultiplexing.txt is python code for de-multiplexing files and reporting index- hopping along with basic QC metrics
* subsample.py is hard-coded for taking one fastq file at a time and downsampling (50%, 25%, and 75%) to verify the effect of sequencing depth in downstream NGS analysis.
* 10x_to_TCRdist takes VDJ files from 10x experiments and modify them to be used as input for the TCRdist software to calculate hamming distance between TCR CDR regions and grouping them.
* input_for_GLIPH takes files from 10x VDJ experiment and Adaptive and modifies them to be used as input for analysis with GLIPH
